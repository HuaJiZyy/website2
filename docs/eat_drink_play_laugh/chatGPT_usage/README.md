# ChatGPT用法

1. 润色自己的英文。可以把自己的破烂英文喂给ChatGPT，让它检查语法错误/语气/改写：
* I wrote a piece about [xyz]. Can you make it more [neutral, professional, etc.]
* Rewrite the following piece of text in a [tone] way/ advanced English.

2. 写邮件/Interview Feedback/Performance Review。可以直接告诉ChatGPT你的工作情况，提供一些背景信息和关键词，让ChatGPT补上假大空的套话部分：
* I am a [title] on [team/project]. I just completed [xyz] and need to write an email to inform my team of [abc]. Can you help me write an email that sounds neutral and professional?
* I am a [title] on [team/project]. I interviewed/worked with [name] for/on [role/project]. I appreciated that [a/b/c], but would like to provide some constructive feedback on [e/d/f]. Can you help me write an interview feedback/ performance review that sounds non-judgemental and positive?

3. 总结会议记录/文章要点。
* Can you give me a summary/outline of the following text/article, in bullet points?
