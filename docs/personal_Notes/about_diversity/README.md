## About Diversity <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

I attended a high school known for its strict “Hengshui model” where students are subjected to intense supervision and every minute of the day is dedicated to studying. While this system was designed to maximize academic results, it left little room for individuality. Unlike most of my peers, I found it difficult to conform to the rigid rules and the grueling schedule of over 15 hours of concentrated study daily. This relentless routine took a toll on my health, disrupting my sleep and metabolism and eventually leading to severe physical and mental stress. By the later years of high school, I even developed tinnitus due to the overwhelming pressure. Unsurprisingly, my performance on the highly competitive college entrance exam was disappointing. The outcome left me with no options, not even among the less selective institutions.

Fortunately, my parents recognized the limitations of traditional secondary education and allowed me to take a gap year to study at home. This change gave me the freedom to adopt a learning style that suited me better, one that embraced individuality and flexibility. Leveraging online resources, I was able to study efficiently and rediscover my passion for learning. In just one year, I achieved what many deemed impossible—I gained admission to Dalian University of Technology, one of the most prestigious and competitive universities in China. Ironically, my former high school boasted a high rate of admission to prestigious universities, yet my own success came only after leaving its system.

This unconventional educational journey has shaped my perspectives in profound ways. I realized that diverse learning environments not only foster resilience and creativity but also promote a sense of belonging for individuals with different needs and perspectives. I bring this understanding to every academic or collaborative environment I enter, embracing diversity of thought and individuality as essential elements for innovation and growth.

At Dalian University of Technology, I encountered a teaching philosophy that emphasized flexibility and encouraged independent thinking. The university granted me the freedom to choose my major and courses and to explore fields that sparked my curiosity. It was here that I developed a deep fascination with computer science, ultimately declaring it as my major. This environment respected individuality and allowed me to thrive—not only in academics but also in research, coding, and even social and leisure activities. I was able to learn at a sustainable pace, gaining deeper insights and stronger skills. These experiences have fueled my passion for creating technologies that make education more accessible and equitable, particularly for students from underrepresented or underserved backgrounds.

As someone who has personally experienced the transformative power of diversity and inclusivity in education, I am particularly drawn to the University of California, Davis, for its commitment to fostering an inclusive environment. The university’s emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, exemplified by initiatives like The IDEA (The Institute for Diversity, Equity, and Advancement), aligns perfectly with my commitment to advancing these values. I believe that my unique educational journey and perspectives will allow me to contribute meaningfully to this vibrant community. The opportunity to grow alongside individuals from diverse backgrounds, exchanging ideas and embracing challenges, inspires me to pursue excellence in computer science. -->
