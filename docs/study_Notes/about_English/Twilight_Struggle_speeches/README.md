## Speeches in Twilight Struggle

1. *Harry S. Truman(杜鲁门), The Truman Doctrine Speech, 1947:*
   - The seeds of **totalitarian** **regimes** are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and **strife**. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died.

2. *Harry S. Truman(杜鲁门), 1949:*
   - Our efforts are made in the belief that men and nations can cooperate, and that there are no international problems which men of good will cannot solve or adjust.

3. *Harry S. Truman(杜鲁门), 1949:*
   - The challenge of the 20th century is the challenge of human relations, and not of **impersonal** natural forces.

4. *Dwight D. Eisenhower(艾森豪威尔), Atoms for Peace, 1953:*
   - So my country's purpose is to help us move out of the dark **chamber** of horrors into the light, to find a way by which the minds of men, the hopes of men, the souls of men everywhere, can move forward toward peace and happiness and well being.

5. *John F. Kennedy(肯尼迪), Inaugural Address, 1961:*
   - We dare not **tempt** them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.

6. *John F. Kennedy(肯尼迪), Inaugural Address, 1961:*
   - And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country.

7. *John F. Kennedy(肯尼迪), Address During The Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962:*
   - Our goal is not the victory of might, but the **vindication** of right — not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom, here in this hemisphere, and, we hope, around the world. God willing, that goal will be achieved.

8. *Richard Nixon(尼克松), First Inaugural Address, 1969:*
   - For the first time, because the people of the world want peace, and the leaders of the world are afraid of war, the times are on the side of peace.

9. *Jimmy Carter(卡特), Address to the Nation on the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, 1980:*
   - But surely one such lesson learned by the world at great cost is that **aggression**, **unopposed**, becomes a contagious disease.

0. *Ronald Reagan(里根), Evil Empire Speech, 1983:*
   - I believe that communism is another sad, **bizarre** chapter in human history whose last – last pages even now are being written.

1. *Ronald Reagan(里根), Berlin Wall Speech, 1987:*
   - Mr. Gorbachev, **tear** down this wall!

2. *Ronald Reagan(里根), Berlin Wall Speech, 1987:*
   - The totalitarian world produces **backwardness** because it does such violence to the spirit, **thwarting** the human impulse to create, to enjoy, to **worship**.

   - I have never believed that democracy brings progress, I know it to have brought **regression**.
