In my view, the advantages of a maternity break outweigh disadvantages.

Granted, it is true that break of women workers result in the lack of staff in companies and institutions ,which can lead to financial problems on account of extra cost demanded to employ temporary workers.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that the benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. The first fact to note is that one-month-break is good for babies' fitness, for more babies are enabled to be cared by their moms, rather than other relationships or third party institutions. UK has a low rate of children diseases. That's because in UK, moms who have just got their babies can take a one-year off from work, with their salaries paid. And even a extend of six months' time is available if they want, with 50% of salary paid.

Also noteworthy is the fact that maternity break can create job opportunities for students who need part-time jobs. These students get experience helpful to their jobs in the future. According to a statistic made by several universities, employees once had part-time jobs perform better at their jobs, whose rate to be appreciated by the manager is higher as well, especially when their part-time jobs are in the same field of current jobs.

To sum up, based on the aforementioned facts and analysis, although maternity break affects causes finance problems of employers, yet the fitness of children are assuranced, in addition, there will be temporary job opportunities for students' part-time jobs. Therefore, it is plain for all to see that there are more advantages than disadvantages.

Nowadays, people tend to buy more and more consumer goods, whose production causes damage to the environment. The objective of this essay is to identify the potential causes of such worrying problem as well as appropriate ways of dealing with it.

There are a wide range of factors that account for such situation. The most common factor is the use of disposable products. Made of wood or plastic, these products are definately environmental unfriendly, such as towels, and disposable raincoats. In USA, a large number of people rely on disposable cleaner to clean the room. For a sixty-squaremeter apartment, one cleaner is needed each time, and even two are required for a same-large apartment which has a pet cat or dog in it. Another contributing factor is the growth of population. Scientists predict that the population on earth will be over 9 billion before the year of 2050, while in 2000, the figure was only 5 billion. The polulation is growing rapidly in many countries, especially developing ones. The more people, the more demand for food, drinks as well as clothes, which lead to more natural damage.

Accordingly, proper solutions should be adopted in case this problem continues to deteriorate. To begin with, government should increase the tax of factories which produce disposable things. This can press them to develop other environmental friendly things, instead of the previous products. In addition, stop encouraging people to have more babies. For example, in some countries, delay the policy which give people who have a baby bonus or some welfare, then they may be unlikely to have babies, who will use vast number of consumer goods in their whole life.

To sum up, based on the aforementioned facts and analysis, it is clear that the abuse of disposable products, as well as the growth of population cause damage to the nature, and government should encourage people to have less babies, and add tax to disposable production as soon as possible.

Some countries provide secondary students a general education, while others give education which focus on only a little subjects which will develop to his or her career. In my view, student should learn majority of subjects at secondary schools, rather than just focusing the career.

To begin with, the first fact to note is that with an average learning education, student are more likely to find what subjects or career they are really keen on. It was the 1980s when Japan children used to focus on a narrow range of subjects, as the government tended to do so, which is considered to lead to today's massive unemployment. Vast number of Japanese suffer from the stress caused by attending jobs which they're not interested in. If average education was embarked, the condition may not deteriorate like this.

Also noteworthy is that some knowledge learnt by secondary pupils which wasn't met their career, contribute to their second work skills. Karran, a professor from Colunbia University, argues that some basic knowledge could usually develop to skills which are not easily to be managed by others. She also uses a term "uni-department" to discribe people who have more than one professional skills, which manifected to be needed by today's tecniqal trend.

Nevertheless, it is argued by some people that  due to the fact that focusing on less subjects gives children extra time to be ready for a career. However, it seems more suitable to dicide a life-time career during university time, when students have become maturer, as well as more experience has been accumulated. It seems that there isn't anywhere better at training students' professional skills than departments in universities, or colleges either.

To sum up, based on the aforementioned facts and analysis, it is clear that a general education has positive effect on the form of second professional skills, and it makes students easier to find a job suitable to their characters. Therefore, it is plain for all to see that a general education across a range of subjects is approprate in today's world.

While some believe that the research of alien has many advantages, there are others who criticize the proposal. From my perspective, sending messages to the space is far more beneficial than one might expected.

On the one hand, it is argued by some people that contact with other life forms is a bad idea, due to the fact that danger may be caused by those aliens. The techlevel of other planets is unknown, it's possible that once aliens discover the earth, they come to destroy our civilization, on account of exploit humans as their slaves.

On the other hand, many people tend to disagree, and they believe that these massages are in favor of the exploration of the universe. These messages travel very fast, and never stop because there is no air in the space. So they can discover a massive area of universal frontier. Finding another planet which is suitable for humans has become more and more essential. This needs a large range of universal exploration, which can be provided by contacts with aliens. 

As far as I am concerned, I side with the idea that try to contact with aliens, given the fact that these contacts can discover more areas of the space. More importantly, it should be noted that finding another planet is helpful for the development of new kinds of fuels, because we can possibly find rare resources in the newly-found planets, which is in great demand in recent years. Old kinds of fuels make environment pollution deteriorating, and most of whom are likely to be used up in a couple of decades.

To sum up, based on the aforementioned facts and analysis, it is clear that sending messages to the space help mankind discover more universal areas, but also new types of fuels. Although aliens might attack humans, yet we can improve our defense ability, such as developing confidental messages, or inventing new weapons. Therefore, it is plain for all to see that it's beneficial to send messages in order to contact with alien civilization.

Nowadays a large amount of advertising aiming at children should be banned because of the negative effects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Some people are strong advocates of advertisements aiming at children because they have a positive influence in economic development. Nevertheless, I am fully convinced that adevertisements aiming at children have more adverse impacts on youth, both physical and mental.

To begin with, the first fact to note is that these advertisements would develop bad shopping habits, especially for children, whose consume habit hasn't entirely formed. According to the Guardian's statistic, 54% of British parents have met the condition which their children asked them to buy toys or food in an unreasonable amount or price, after the youngsters seeing these productions on ADs. These children may be not able to buy things in a socially acceptable way in the future.

Also noteworthy is that most of productions which are shown in advertisements are not good for children's fitness. It's possible for children to expend their pocket money on attractive snack or confectionery shown on screens, rather than nutritient food and meals. In China, thousands of children develop indigestion or metabolism-disorder every year, after eating too much junk food, or drinking lots of beverage they have seen on television ADs. This condition is deteriorating, especially in big cities, where children have more chance to see ADs.

To sum up, based on the aforementioned facts and analysis, it is clear that ADs aiming at children have bad effect on children's shopping habit, as well as their physical health. Therefore, it is plain for all to see that we should cease showing children these advertisements.
