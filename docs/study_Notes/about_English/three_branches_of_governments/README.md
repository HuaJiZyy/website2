## More Info

The U.S. federal government is divided into three independent and inter-checking branches:

1. **Legislative Branch**: This is **Congress**, which includes two chambers — the **Senate** and the **House of Representatives**. It is responsible for enacting laws.

2. **Executive Branch**: Led by the **President**, including the **Vice President** and the President's **Cabinet**, as well as various federal agencies. The executive branch is in charge of enforcing laws and managing the day-to-day affairs of the nation.

3. **Judicial Branch**: Composed of the **Courts**, with the **Supreme Court** at its apex. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting laws and the Constitution, and for resolving legal disputes.

This system of checks and balances is designed to ensure that power is not concentrated in a single institution and to maintain the stability of the political system through mutual checks among the branches. The President, as the head of the executive branch, ensures that laws are properly enforced and has the power to veto legislation passed by the legislative branch.
